    One day, all I wanted was a solid pair of trunks—just a quick, simple buy. But the second I hit the internet, it was like stepping into a maze of ads, ‘must-have’ lists, and life hacks that seemed too good to be true. And honestly, it feels like you can’t trust anything online anymore.
    So, I got fed up and decided to take matters into my own hands. Started testing out everything myself, from clothing and travel gear to random productivity hacks and even parenting tips.
