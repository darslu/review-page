			Merino Wool and Performance Fabrics Outshine the Rest
		</h3>
		<p class="mt-8 text-center leading-relaxed">
			While cotton and nylon are common, it struggled to keep up in both durability and performance.
			Merino wool and performance blends consistently outperformed, resisting odor, holding shape,
			and staying comfortable through multi-day wear. One merino wool pair lasted five straight days
			of travel—including workouts—without losing freshness or form.

			Whether you’re looking for all-day comfort, workout performance, or travel-ready durability,
			these picks have proven their worth in every category.

	<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
		I’ve spent months testing over 15 different brands of boxer briefs—putting them through long
		workdays, intense workouts, and countless washes—to see how they really perform. I’ve looked at
		everything: fabric quality, stretch, breathability, moisture-wicking, and how they hold up after
		repeated use. Each pair was checked for fit, support, and durability, so you don’t have to go
		through the trial and error.
	</p>
	<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
		When I recommend a pair, it’s because they’ve proven themselves—tested, worn, and measured in
		real-world conditions. No fluff, no hype—just honest insights backed by experience and data.
		These boxer briefs have shown they can handle daily life, and I trust they’ll do the same for
		you.
